# Installing OS
---
I recommand using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) in install an OS onto your SD Card. You will need another computer together with an SD card reader to install the image. It is advised to [reformat](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) your SD card if it was used before.

## Raspberry Pi Imager

Here's how you use RPI Imager:

1. Plug in your SD card reader with your SD card loaded in
2. Open RPI Imager and choose:
    - Raspberry Pi Device: Raspberry Pi 4 (Your own RPI model)
    - Operating System: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
    - Storage: SD Card you wish to use
3. Pressing NEXT will lead you to a new screen, click on advanced options
    - Hostname: Choose your own hostname
    - SSH: Use password authentication
    - Username & password: Set your own credentials
    - Wireless LAN: Enter your own WiFi SSID and password
    - Local settings: Set your own
4. Install
